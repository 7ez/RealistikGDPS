# RealistikGDPS
The Python-based backend for RealistikGDPS, made as as a drag and drop replacement for our existing solution.

## What is this?
This is a modern Python implementation of the Geometry Dash server protocol meant to power my Geometry Dash Private server.
It is written in asynchronous, modern Python and is meant as a drag-and-drop replacement for our current [PHP based infrastructure](https://github.com/Cvolton/GMDprivateServer).

## Key differences
While we aim to be as close to a drag-and-drop replacement as possible, there are key implementation differences that were determined to be neccessary for progress:

- Removal of unregistered ("green") users due to security concerns
- Usage of Redis as a secondary database

## How to set up?
TODO: Once the project is usabele.

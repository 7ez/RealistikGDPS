# RealistikGDPS
The Python-based backend for RealistikGDPS, made as an expandable solution for a GDPS of any size.

## What is this?
This is a modern Python implementation of the Geometry Dash server protocol meant to power my Geometry Dash Private server.
It is written in asynchronous, modern Python and is meant as a replacement for our current [PHP based infrastructure](https://github.com/Cvolton/GMDprivateServer).

## How to set up?
TODO: Once the project is usable.

You may use environment variables (no `.env` file support yet) for config by setting the `USE_ENV_CONFIG` variable to "1".

## Upgrading an existing server
Assuming your server is based off [Cvolton's server implementation](https://github.com/Cvolton/GMDprivateServer), there will be a migration utility created in the near future.
